    <h1>Bleach! The Story of Ichigo Kurosaki</h1>
    <img src="images/591Ichigo_profile.png" alt="Ichigo: The Hollow Form of Ichigo Kuroshaki">
    <p><a href="https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Ichigo_Kurosaki">Ichigo Kurosaki</a> (黒崎 一護, Kurosaki Ichigo) is a Human who is also a Substitute Shinigami. Ichigo is the son of Isshin and Masaki Kurosaki, and older brother of Karin and Yuzu. He is also married to Orihime Inoue and has a son named Kazui Kurosaki.</p>
    <p>Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about for years on end. He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He likes to wear slim fitting clothes.</p>
    <p>He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami attire, with the addition of a strap across his chest. Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.</p>
