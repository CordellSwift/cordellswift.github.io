    <h1><div id="demotext">Bleach! The Story of Ichigo!</div></h1>
    <img src="images/591Ichigo_profile.png" alt="Ichigo: The Hollow Form of Ichigo Kuroshaki">
    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p><a href="https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Ichigo_Kurosaki">Ichigo Kurosaki</a> <strong>(黒崎 一護, Kurosaki Ichigo)</strong> is a Human who is also a Substitute Shinigami. Ichigo is the son of Isshin and Masaki Kurosaki, and older brother of Karin and Yuzu. He is also married to Orihime Inoue and has a son named Kazui Kurosaki.</p>
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bleach/images/8/87/582Ichigo%27s_new_outfit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/190?cb=20170905005803&path-prefix=en" alt ="Ichigo: Anime Depiction" align = "left"><p>Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about for years on end. He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He likes to wear slim fitting clothes.</p>
    <p>He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami attire, with the addition of a strap across his chest. Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.</p>
    <p>It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom. Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including Jūshirō Ukitake, to note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, the former lieutenant of the 13th Division. After training in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends.After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.</p>
    <p>Seventeen months after defeating Aizen, Ichigo's overall appearance does not change, but he becomes taller again and grows sideburns. After regaining his powers, seemingly caused by remaining energy from his Fullbring, Ichigo's Shinigami attire consists of a thicker strap across his chest. He has four black vertical lines on his forearms and black, tattoo-like bands crossing over his chest, wrists, and ankles. Similar bands, but with white ends, lie around his neck as collars.</p>
    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>When he was younger, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world, always smiling when he was with Masaki and regularly holding her hand. Despite crying whenever he lost in a match at the dojo he attended, Ichigo started to smile again as soon as he saw Masaki when she came to pick him up. At a very young age, Ichigo heard his father saying his name means "to protect one thing," which instilled in him a desire to protect his mother. When his sisters were born, he began attending a dojo for the sake of protecting them. Since then, the number of people he wishes to protect has continued to grow, causing Ichigo to risk his life to protect both the people close to him and complete strangers</p>
    <p>As a teenager, Ichigo is stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive. Despite claiming not to care about what other people think about him, he attempts to maintain a detached and "cool" image. He generally keeps his face set in a near-permanent scowl, with his eyebrows drawn together. His outspoken, hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged, and if somebody picks a fight with him, he cannot help fighting back. He coldly refers to his teachers as "instructors". He is genuinely compassionate and empathetic towards others, promising to bring a Plus flowers and a toy plane, or soothing others when they become upset.</p>
    <p>Ichigo is a capable student, ranked 23rd in his year at school, who studies regularly and does not neglect his schoolwork. He works as hard as he does to overcome the misconceptions many have about him based on his hair color and fighting. Ichigo hates fortune telling, horoscopes, feng shui, psychics, and anyone whose trade involves taking money from people for things they cannot see.[35] He has difficulty remembering people's faces and names. Ichigo becomes extremely shy and uncomfortable around nude or immodestly dressed women, a fact both Yoruichi Shihōin and Rangiku Matsumoto have teased him for. Ichigo is often disrespectful when talking to those older than himself, calling Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto "gramps" and referring to several of the Shinigami captains by their given names without using honorifics.</p>
    <p>When it comes to fighting, Ichigo has a complex sense of honor; he regularly seeks to exact revenge for the cruel actions of his opponent, such as instilling the fear of being murdered in Shrieker and cutting off the right arm of Yammy Llargo in retaliation for him ripping Yasutora Sado's right arm off. He often taunts and belittles his opponents when fighting, sometimes attacking without warning. Ichigo has a strong desire to win his fights, but in what he views as a legitimate manner.[50] To this end, he has often refused the aid of his inner Hollow, even when knowing it would allow him to win. Ichigo's resolve in battle can waver at times, which can impede his fighting prowess, and goes into a state of depression and self-loathing when he loses a major battle or lets a friend down.</p>
    <p>Ichigo despises those who mistreat their allies in any way, even if they are his own enemies. He was disgusted when Yammy calls Ulquiorra Cifer, Nnoitra Gilga, and Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez "trash"</p>

    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xc_dtY8LV1U/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Ichigo vs Aizen" align = "left" height = "300" width="300"><p>Ichigo arrives with his unconscious father in Karakura Town in Soul Society as Lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto grieves for Gin Ichimaru, who was earlier attacked and fatally wounded by Aizen. Startled by Ichigo's arrival, Aizen turns his attention towards him.[1] Now taller and with longer hair from his time in the Dangai, Ichigo places Isshin Kurosaki on the ground and thanks him. After searching for the Reiatsu of his sisters to make sure they are safe, Ichigo greets his friends and tells them to stay where they are.</p>
    <p>Telling Ichigo he is disheartened because he does not sense any Reiatsu coming from him, Aizen states Ichigo has failed to grasp the opportunity he presented to evolve. Interrupting him, Ichigo says he wants to move their fight elsewhere. Arrogantly stating Ichigo cannot harm him, Aizen refuses Ichigo's request. Grabbing Aizen by the face, Ichigo moves him away from Karakura Town before telling a stunned Aizen he will finish the fight in an instant.</p>
    <p>Commenting upon Ichigo's words, Aizen tells Ichigo he understands why he has lost his Reiatsu before claiming Ichigo has not "parted" with his Reiatsu, but has instead "thrown it away". Admitting he does not know how Ichigo achieved this, Aizen theorizes Ichigo has turned the entirety of his Reiatsu into raw physical power for his spiritual body, increasing his strength, speed, throwing ability, and so on. Detailing Ichigo's powers as nothing more than physical enhancement, Aizen laments Ichigo giving up on attempting to fight with him on terms of Reiatsu.</p>
    <p>Telling Ichigo he should give up all hope, for even with his enhanced physical strength, he is still far from being able to reach him, Aizen spreads his wings and attempts to attack Ichigo from behind in a flash of blinding light, resulting in the two clashing. When a nearby mountain is cut in half, Aizen states he can change the shape of the earth with a single swing of his blade. Acknowledging even he did not expect his power to rise this high, Aizen thanks Ichigo for the opportunity to test this Hollow- and Shinigami-transcending power as much as he pleases. As Aizen moves to attack Ichigo head-on, the two clash again, causing significant devastation to the surrounding area. Commenting on their appearances, Aizen notes the similarities between each other, namely the agglutination of their right arms and Zanpakutō, and how it has brought forth a revolutionary discovery in terms of what form Zanpakutō might eventually take. Ichigo nonchalantly blocks Aizen's Zanpakutō with his bare hand. Noting he understands the dimensions of Ichigo's evolution and his own are very different, Aizen proclaims he can bring himself to crush Ichigo's sword with a single blow if so so much as wishes to do so. Moving to attack head-on, Aizen is surprised when Ichigo nonchalantly stops his blade with his bare hand. As the attack destroys the land behind Ichigo, who remains in place and uninjured, Ichigo calmly asks Aizen what he is so surprised about and wonders if it is so hard to believe he could stop his sword before asking Aizen if he is scared of seeing something he cannot understand or comprehend before his eyes.</p>
    <p>Pushed back a distance, Aizen collects himself and tells Ichigo to not talk so triumphantly because his physical strength momentarily exceeded his own. Deciding to crush Ichigo with Kidō in order to prevent any further "miracles", Aizen uses Hadō #90. Kurohitsugi with its full incantation and proudly gloats at the full power of his Kidō, noting it is a power the likes of which Ichigo cannot comprehend. As the Kidō begins to surround him, Ichigo destroys it with a wave of his hand and tells a stunned Aizen he did not notice Ichigo is currently stronger than he is. Noting he was the one who blew the mountain away with his sword, not Aizen, Ichigo moves in and strikes.</p>
    <p>As Ichigo slashes him across his torso, Aizen moves away in a flash of light to a nearby cliff. Telling Aizen it was a strange feeling when he put distance between them, Ichigo asks him why he does not ask the questions this time and why he has put distance between them. As his wound begins to heal, Aizen asks Ichigo if he likes how he has stopped his sword, destroyed his Kidō, and injured his body. Enraged, Aizen yells at Ichigo to abandon his Human arrogance. As he transforms once again, Aizen states he now sees the Hōgyoku will not allow him to fall behind a Human as one of the skulls fires a small spiritual energy blast.</p>
    <p>The energy blast creates an enormous explosion and shockwave, which can be felt miles away in Karakura Town. In the resulting crater, Ichigo survives the blast, though it destroys the upper half of his shihakushō and singes his left arm, which he used to block the blast. Stating he sees taking this attack only partially burned Ichigo, Aizen notes his left arm is most likely useless to him now. Moving to attack Ichigo, Aizen strikes him, sending him flying into the crater. Grabbing Ichigo by the throat, Aizen surrounds him with his appendages and creates a circle of charged spiritual energy around Ichigo. Asking Ichigo if he can hear him, Aizen theorizes how Ichigo destroyed the barrier between Shinigami and Hollow and became transcendental.</p>
    <p>As Ichigo initiates the technique, Aizen expresses surprise at the new form he has taken. Explaining how Saigo no Getsuga Tenshō means becoming Getsuga itself, Ichigo reveals he will lose all of his Shinigami powers if he uses this technique. Enraged, Aizen states such a thing is impossible because a mere Human cannot surpass him. As Ichigo activates Mugetsu, darkness falls over the land. Surrounded by the darkness, Aizen plummets to the ground below. As the darkness dissipates, Ichigo lands on the ground as the blue bands covering his face begin to crack and peel off. Standing near where Aizen crashed into the ground, Ichigo watches as a large gash on Aizen's back begins to heal itself. When Aizen looks up, Ichigo asks him if he is still regenerating.</p>
    <p>As his hair returns to normal and he returns to his original form, Ichigo falls to the ground and realizes his Shinigami powers are disappearing. Having mostly returned to his fourth form, Aizen gets up and tells Ichigo he has lost before asking him to look as his Zanpakutō begins to disintegrate. Telling Ichigo he should understand what this means, Aizen claims the Hōgyoku has decided he does not need a Zanpakutō. As Aizen proclaims he has risen even higher than Ichigo, who has just lost this power, Ichigo looks on as Aizen is affected by a Kidō spell hidden inside his body by Kisuke Urahara, who appears at the scene to explain the mechanics of the spell. The two converse briefly before Aizen is finally sealed as Ichigo looks away.</p>
    <p>Sometime after their battle with Aizen, Ichigo asks Urahara where everyone is. When Urahara reveals they all wanted to come and talk to him, but actually doing it was difficult, Ichigo believes Urahara erased their memories from this explanation, but he says he did not do it this time, which relieves Ichigo, who is sick of hiding it and can now tell them himself. Urahara tells Ichigo Aizen's seal structure will be dealt with by Central 46, which seems to depress him a little. Urahara asks Ichigo why he is making this face, but Ichigo is wondering about his sadness himself. As Urahara tries to cheer him up, Ichigo asks him if Aizen was really rejected by the Hōgyoku</p>
    <p>Recalling his father telling him how the Hōgyoku materializes the "hearts" in its surroundings, Ichigo wonders if Aizen himself wished to lose his power. Explaining how he felt only solitude in Aizen's blade in his battle with Aizen, Ichigo theorizes Aizen had always been searching for someone who was standing at the same viewpoint as he was because he was on his own level from the start, and his heart may have wished he was just an ordinary Shinigami when he gave up. Orihime Inoue, Uryū Ishida, Rukia Kuchiki, Yasutora Sado, and Lieutenant Renji Abarai find Ichigo, who asks them if it is okay for them to be up like this. As Rukia says this is her line, a crying Orihime says she knew it was him in the distance, though Ichigo's longer hair made her think she was wrong at first. Laughing, Ichigo suddenly collapses as everyone rushes to help him.</p>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XAO5sMb7o5A/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Ichigo vs Ulquoria" align="left" height="300" width="300"><p>As Rukia Kuchiki, Yasutora Sado, and Lieutenant Renji Abarai continue their battle against Rudbornn Chelute inside Las Noches, with Rudbornn creating more of his subordinates using Calaveras, Sado fires an El Directo at Rudbornn, who, using his subordinates to create a shield against the attack, claims his powers have no limit, prompting Rukia to state she never thought Rudbornn would use his own subordinates as a shield.</p>
    <p>Explaining her plan to Sado and Renji, Rukia states she will use Some no mai, Hakuren to freeze Rudbornn's soldiers, Sado will attack them, and Renji will finish Rudbornn off with Hihio Zabimaru. As they put this plan into motion, when Renji uses Hikotsu Taihō with Hihio Zabimaru against the now-vulnerable Rudbornn, Rudbornn creates more of his solders to stop the attack, causing Renji's Bankai to collapse. Stating it was an excellent effort, Rudbornn states with an infinite number of soldiers, no one can reach him. As Rudbornn prepares to finish them off, he is caught by Rukia's ice. As his body begins to freeze from the bottom up, Rukia reveals the real plan was to keep Rudbornn's attention away from herself and his weakness. As Rudbornn curses his opponents, his body is fully encased in ice before an enraged, but injured, Yammy Llargo, rising, punches Rudbornn.</p>
    <p>Renji and Sado are surprised by this outburst, with Renji asking if this is the Arrancar whom Captain Tōshirō Hitsugaya warned them about. Confirming this, Sado states the Yammy before them is much larger than the one he faced in Karakura Town. Yammy proclaims he will get his revenge on Uryū Ishida, who defeated him earlier.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, a red Cero, blasting downwards through the dome, creates a huge explosion within Las Noches. In his new Hollow form, Ichigo throws Ulquiorra, now unconscious with more than half of his body blown away from the explosion, to the ground. As Ichigo, walking towards Ulquiorra, prepares to finish him off, Uryū, grabbing his wrist, tells Ichigo to stop, for the battle is over, and attempts to convince Ichigo if he goes through with it, he will no longer be considered Human. Throwing his Zanpakutō into Uryū's stomach, Ichigo tells Orihime Inoue he will protect her as well.</p>
    <p>As Ichigo approaches Uryū, Orihime blames herself for Ichigo's transformation, having called out to him to protect her, and asks herself why she keeps relying on Ichigo, regardless of how many steps she has taken to protect herself and her friends. As Ichigo starts to charge a Cero, Ulquiorra, appearing behind him, severs one of his horns, causing the Cero to implode and shatter Ichigo's mask, returning him to Human form. Watching Ichigo fall to the ground, he notes his body is regenerating, but it is only a front, for the internal organs which were blown way will not regenerate.</p>
    <p>As Ichigo's Reiatsu flows out of his body and back in to repair the hole in his chest, a surprised Ulquiorra asks if this is High-Speed Regeneration. Waking up, Ichigo is horrified to see his Zanpakutō in Uryū's stomach. Pulling Tensa Zangetsu out of Uryū, Ulquiorra, tossing it to Ichigo, demands to finish the fight. When Ichigo questions if this and Ulquiorra's severe injuries were created by him, Ulquiorra remains silent. When Ichigo asks Ulquiorra to cut off his own arm and leg so the fight will be fair, Uryū expresses concern to Ichigo. As Ulquiorra, complying, is about to do so, his body begins to turn to ash.</p>
    <p>Realizing he is finished, Ulquiorra requests Ichigo finish him off, or else the fight will never be considered finished. When Ichigo, declining, states he did not want to win this way, Ulquiorra, woefully stating even to the very end, Ichigo never does what he wants or expects, expresses his growing interest in Humans. When Ulquiorra, reaching out, asks Orihime if she afraid of him, Orihime, stating she is not afraid, tries to grab hold of Ulquiorra's hand, but it begins to dissolve into ash before she is able to. From her gesture, he, realizing what a heart is, believes there, in his disintegrated hand, is a heart. Ulquiorra fades into the wind.</p>
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bleach/images/f/fa/Ep38IchigoVsKenpachi.png/revision/latest?cb=20190606040130&path-prefix=en" alt="Ichigo vs Kenpachi" align="left" height="300" width="300"><p>As Ichigo, Ganju Shiba, and 4th Division 7th Seat Hanatarō Yamada move towards the Shishinrō in order to rescue Rukia Kuchiki, they are stopped in their tracks by a monstrous Reiatsu. As Ganju wonders who it belongs to, Ichigo, stating someone strong is nearby, says they should run as far as possible before they find them. On top of a building, a mysterious man, stating they are finally here, tries to remember which one was the "one".</p>
    <p>As Ichigo runs, he thinks to himself about how even though they have been running for a while, he still feels very close to the source of the Reiatsu, and it feels like its owner is constantly holding a sword to his neck. When Hanatarō, stopping, says he has run out of energy, Ganju, saying he is a troublesome guy, carries him on his shoulders. Looking at each member of the group, the man states neither Ganju nor Hanatarō are the one. His eye lands on Ichigo, who hears a voice asking if he is "it". Turning around, Ichigo sees the man sitting on a rooftop.</p>
    <p>As the man says to not just stand there and stare, Ichigo is seemingly impaled by a sword. When he sees he has not been impaled, Ichigo realizes it was an illusion generated by the man's killing intent. Moving behind him, the man asks if he is Ichigo Kurosaki. When Ichigo asks how he knows his name and who he is, the man reminds him of how Ikkaku Madarame told him about him. As Ichigo, recalling his conversation with Ikkaku, tries to remember his name, the man, revealing himself to be Captain Kenpachi Zaraki of the 11th Division, states he has come here to kill him.</p>
    <p>Thinking to himself it is no wonder Kenpachi's Reiatsu is so great, Ichigo says he is completely different from anyone else he has met thus far. Reiterating his previous declaration of being here to kill Ichigo, Kenpachi asks if Ichigo, having not said anything in response, is ready to start now. Reaching for his Zanpakutō, Ichigo sees Hanatarō and Ganju on the ground behind him. Saying they are just shaken by the Reiatsu, Ganju tells Ichigo to not worry about them and instead look ahead, as if he does not, he will be beaten in an instant.</p>
    <p>When a small girl, popping up from behind Kenpachi, tries to move over to Hanatarō, Ichigo knocks her back. Telling Ganju to take Hanatarō out of there, he states he will try to stop Kenpachi. When Ganju questions him doing this by himself, Ichigo tells him to shut up and go. When Ichigo states he is surprised Kenpachi is not chasing them, for the captains' objective is to stop the Ryoka, Kenpachi, repeating himself once again, says he does not care about his friends or Rukia, who can die anywhere they want for all he cares.</p>
    <p>Seeing Ichigo's battle stance, Kenpachi, complimenting him on it, says though it still has openings, it has high Reiatsu. Acknowledging he understands why Ikkaku lost to him, Kenpachi, stating Ichigo is still weaker than him, decides to give Ichigo a fighting chance. Baring his chest, Kenpachi tells Ichigo to cut him anywhere and not hold back.</p>
    <p>When Ichigo refuses to attack an unarmed opponent, Kenpachi, commending him, states it is simply a handicap, and while he appreciates the thought, Ichigo should save his sympathy for someone else. Kenpachi warns him to either kill or be killed.[4] Attacking Kenpachi's exposed chest, Ichigo creates no injury with his Zanpakutō, much to his confusion. Disappointed, Kenpachi, beginning to unsheathe his Zanpakutō, tells Ichigo it is his turn, asking him not to die too quickly.</p>
    <p>When Ichigo's hand starts to bleed, Kenpachi, asking him why he seems to be surprised his sword cannot cut him, pushes Ichigo back with his arm against Ichigo's blade. When the girl states Ichigo's sword is the same as a blade-less sword to Kenpachi, Ichigo is confused. Stating Ichigo's sword cannot scratch him because his Reiatsu is not as strong as his own, Kenpachi, expressing disappointment at having "camped out all night for this", takes out his own Zanpakutō and asks Ichigo to, at the very least place a dent upon his sword.</p>
    <p>Trying to run away from Kenpachi, Ichigo, unable to shake him, ends up running into him at every turn. Getting bored of chasing after him, Kenpachi sits down. Happy when Ichigo confronts him, Kenpachi asks if Ichigo is preparing to die, or if he is surrendering. Refusing to do either, Ichigo, attacking, finally succeeds in injuring Kenpachi.[7] Extremely excited at Ichigo being able to injure him, Kenpachi, telling Ichigo to not relax and to keep his Reiatsu up, attacks him.</p>
    <p>The battle continues with Kenpachi, having the upper hand, happy to see Ichigo improving, commenting on how Ichigo is using the sounds of his bells to determine his position. When Ichigo asks if Kenpachi is underestimating him, having not released his Zanpakutō, Kenpachi reveals his Zanpakutō has no name and has never had a seal on it, so it is currently in its true form. Relieved to hear this, Ichigo goes to attack once again, but Kenpachi, stopping him, explains further about his Zanpakutō's state, stating it is always in its true form because his Reiatsu is so strong, no seal would work on it.</p>
    <p>He stabs his Zanpakutō through Ichigo's, breaking right through it and stabbing Ichigo in the chest, and tells Ichigo he warned him not to relax his Reiatsu, and it has become weak because he saw a chance to win. Retracting his sword, Kenpachi is frustrated the battle was so easy and is now over.[9] As Kenpachi walks away, saying him being able to cut him or hear his bells does not matter if he cannot keep fighting, Ichigo thinks to himself he must not lose here, he must get up and fight, and he must save Rukia. As he watches Kenpachi walk away with his Zanpakutō over his shoulder, the spirit of Zangetsu appears and walks towards him.</p>
    <p>Asking him if he wants to fight, the man says to choose between fighting and living. As Ichigo says he wants to win, the man says he cannot hear him. Saying it is pointless to just fight or live, Ichigo yells that he wants to win. Accepting this, the man, saying he will take him there, envelops him in darkness. After Ichigo realizes that he knows nothing about his own Zanpakutō aside from its name, Zangetsu decides to lend him his power. Ichigo gets up, accompanied by a large burst of Reiatsu, to Kenpachi's surprise.</p>
    <p>Attacking Kenpachi, surprising him further, Ichigo slashes him down the torso. Deflecting Ichigo's next attack, Kenpachi, stabbing his sword into a nearby building, begins to laugh, becoming extremely excited, and says now the fight is just getting started, noting they should drag out the fight. Lunging at Ichigo, he allows his face to get cut by the blade just to get close to Ichigo. As the battle escalates even more, with Kenpachi continuing to fight regardless of his injuries, Ichigo learns of the drive behind Kenpachi's personality.</p>
    <p>Realizing he and Ichigo are evenly matched and he enjoys the feeling and euphoria of the moment, Kenpachi takes off his eyepatch, noting because he considers Ichigo a worthy opponent, it only makes sense to fight him at full power.[11] As Kenpachi's Reiatsu rises as he removes his eyepatch, Ichigo wonders what is going on. Explaining to him what the eyepatch does, Kenpachi, taking out his Zanpakutō, cuts a nearby building in half with one slash. He tells Ichigo he will use all his power to kill him</p>
    <p>When Ichigo increases his power, he greatly impresses Kenpachi. When Ichigo, explaining how he can do so by borrowing Zangetsu's power and fighting side by side with him, states he will never lose to someone like him who only fights by himself, Kenpachi, asking if Zangetsu is Ichigo's Zanpakutō, says he finds it ridiculous to fight side by side with it and borrow its power.</p>
    <p>He believes Zanpakutō are just tools of war and fighting side by side with one are words for weak losers who are afraid to fight on their own. Simultaneously releasing their Reiatsu, they run at each other for a final clash, which releases enough Reiatsu to destroy all the buildings around them.</p>
    <p>The battle ends in a draw, with Ichigo falling first apologizing to his friends. Kenpachi looks down asking why he was apologizing as his blade breaks before he gives Ichigo the victory of the battle.[14] After carrying Kenpachi to another location, the girl calls for Captain Retsu Unohana to heal him. Telling her he lost, but needs to pay him back, Kenpachi, raising his sword, acknowledges he ignored it for a long time, and wants to communicate with it. Not hearing it speak, Kenpachi faints, scaring Yachiru.</p>
